# 2D-to-3D image generator and viewer

Runs locally and privately in your browser.  

Needs a beefy computer and works fastest in Chrome.

## Loading images

- Drag &amp; Drop an image anywhere
- Load image via the menu. Optionally load your own depth map. If none is provided, it is generated.
- Use URL parameters: 
  - `?input=https://domain.com/your-image.jpeg` - Load image, generate depth map. Supports JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF (first frame). In addition to `input`:
    - `&depthmap=https://domain.com/your-depthmap.png` - Bring your own depth map.
    - `&expandDepthmapRadius=5` - Set the Depth Map Expansion to tweak background separation during rendering
    - `&depthmapSize=1024` - Sets Max. Depth Map Size, only used for depth map generation.
  
If you have a non-beefy computer, it might take a while. Click "Wait" if a dialog pops up, or let it run in a background tab. Adjust `Max. Depth Map Size` in the menu accordingly.

## Viewing images

Move your mouse to change perspective. If it feels choppy, adjust the `Render Quality` in the menu.

*Work In Progress:* To view images in real 3D, mirror your computer screen to your VR headset. [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) works well. Switch to `Half SBS` or `Full SBS` in the Tiefling menu, then do the same in Virtual Desktop. Works best in fullscreen. Switch back to normal view in Virtual Desktop to adjust settings.  

## Hosting

It's a static website, all the 3D generation happens in your browser. So, host the contents of the `public` folder yourself however you like. But give it its own domain, it's not tested to work in subfolders yet.

## Todo

- Anaglyph View
- WebXR?
