# 2D-to-3D image generator and viewer

Runs locally and privately in your browser.  
Needs a beefy computer and works fastest in Chrome.

## Loading images

- Drag &amp; Drop an image anywhere
- Load image via the menu. Optionally load your own depth map. If none is provided, it is generated.
- Use URL parameters: 
  - https://tiefling.gerlach.dev?input=https://domain.com/your-image.jpeg - Load image, generate depth map. Supports JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF (first frame)
  - https://tiefling.gerlach.dev?input=https://domain.com/your-image.jpeg&depthmap=https://domain.com/your-depthmap.png - Load image, bring your own depth map.

If you have a non-beefy computer, it might take a while. Click "Wait" if a dialog pops up, or let it run in a background tab. Adjust `Max. Depth Map Size` in the menu accordingly.

## Viewing images

Move your mouse to change perspective. If it feels choppy, adjust the `Render Quality` in the menu.

*Work In Progress:* To view images in real 3D, mirror your computer screen to your VR headset. [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) works well. Switch to `Half SBS` or `Full SBS` in the Tiefling menu, then do the same in Virtual Desktop. Works best in fullscreen. Switch back to normal view in Virtual Desktop to adjust settings.  

## Todo

- Make interface usable in HSBS and FSBS VR views.
- Anaglyph View
- Better background fill that's still fast. Suggestions welcome.
- WebXR?
