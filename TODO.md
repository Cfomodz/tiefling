# Parallax Studio Pro - Implementation Complete ✅

This TODO tracked the development of a complete backend API system for converting 2D images into cinematic 3D parallax videos with professional audio mixing.

## Completed Implementat
### ✅ Core API Infrastructure (Phase 6)
- **Basic Image-to-MP4 Endpoint** - Complete video generation API with configurable parameters
- **Multi-Image Composition Driver** - Advanced composition system with transitions
- **Optimized Processing** - Efficient pipeline with temporary file management

### ✅ Audio Integration & Final Composition (Phase 7)  
- **Audio Mixing System** - Intelligent volume balancing (voiceover 100%, music 20%)
- **Sound Effects Engine** - Multi-track mixing with precise timing control
- **Complete Production Pipeline** - End-to-end image+audio→video system

### ✅ Depth Generation & Processing (Phase 1)
- **AI Depth Estimation** - DepthAnything V2 implementation with GPU acceleration
- **High Quality Processing** - Support for 720p-4K resolution with configurable quality
- **Efficient Pipeline** - Optimized depth map generation and caching

### ✅ Backend Services Architecture
- **Microservice Design** - Four specialized APIs working in concert
- **RESTful Endpoints** - Complete API specification with comprehensive testing
- **Production Ready** - Health monitoring, error handling, and scalability
